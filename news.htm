<p>Foundation of our prestigious roots.   </p>
          <P>&nbsp;The thought about the family, its rich heritage and links gives us great satisfaction wherever we are. Realising the need of keeping strong tieS among the family members Kurudamannil Kudumbayogam built a hall&nbsp; in our ancestral village, Ayroor. Extension envisaging 2000sq.ft. covered area in the front with porch and side’mukappu’ representing the six branches is now added 
          at the&nbsp; 
          cost of Rs. Nine lakhs.&nbsp; It needs some finishing touches and to meet minimum 
          standards of a fair family hall, a kitchen, and&nbsp; toilets&nbsp; also have to be built. 
          It may&nbsp; not look very posh or elegant but serves the family a 
          lot.&nbsp; We thank each and every one of the family members who have worked long 
          and hard and contributed much to its extension.<P>Even though we have the privilege of having a hall, our responsibilities are yet to be fulfilled. The building 
          constructions are more or less over, but still needs funds for 
          maintenance. Managing Committee of the Kudumbayogam is appealing 
          all our family members 
          for kind consideration and contribution towards this project. Memorial plaques can be sponsored by family members at a 
          cost of Rs.25,000 with common design. Already several sponsors have&nbsp; 
          donated to the project. Along with your funds, your constructive suggestions are also invited.
