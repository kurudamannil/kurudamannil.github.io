              </span> 
                <p><span class="normal">There is a wealth of corroborative evidence 
                  to support, and no good reason to doubt the tradition that the 
                  Apostle Saint Thomas arrived in Kodungalloor (Muziris) in Kerala 
                  in 52 AD, preached the gospel, established seven churches, and 
                  moved on to other kingdom, returning to Madras (Mylapore) in 
                  72 AD where he was martyred that year. Writers of the 4th century, 
                  St. Ephrem and St. John Chrysostom knew also about the relics 
                  of St. Thomas resting at that time in Edessa, having been brought 
                  there from India by West Asian merchants. </span></p>
                <p><span class="normal">St.Thomas the Apostle of Jesus Christ 
                  established seven churches. The seven original churches were 
                  located at Malankara (Malayattor?), Palayur (near Chavakkad), 
                  Koovakayal (near North Paravur), Kokkamangalam (South Pallipuram?), 
                  Kollam, Niranam and Nilackel (Chayal). The early Christians 
                  (also known as Nazranikal, St.Thomas Christians, Syrian Christians) 
                  looking for pastures green spread out to interior villages from 
                  Kollam (Quilon) and Kodungalloor. </span></p>
                <p><span class="normal">One such nazrani family in Ayroor village 
                  was known as <i>'tharayilethu' (thaayillum)</i> family. This 
                  ancestral place is situated about one kilometre west of Cherukolpuzha 
                  by the side of the main Thiruvella-Cherkolpuzha road. Today 
                  there is a<a href="img/pillar.jpg"width="157" height="232"> marble tower</a> 
		erected by the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Thayillumuae/">' thayillam kudumbayogam' </a>
                  as a landmark cherishing the root family of so many well-known 
                  branches. There are dark pages in the history of Kerala, however 
                  there are documentation dating back to AD 974 ('mambilly sasanm' 
                  ) where Ayroor village is decreed to establish a Hindu temple. 
                  Five families are mentioned in the historical records where 
                  Tharayilleth is one of the five ancient. The sixth generation 
                  from 'thaayillam' was the '<i>thengumthottathil</i> 'family. 
                  The eldest of the two sons of Thengumthottathil Soman Tharakan 
                  (1748-1830), called <b>Iripootty</b> founded the glorious Kurudamannil 
                  dynasty. Iripootty married Elayacharamma, from Mallapally Kaiyalathu 
                  family and settled in "<i>Kurud-mon</i>"(small farm) around 
                  AD1800. The 'kurud mon' skirted by the '<i>kaduva thod</i>' 
                  (tigers brook) and Pamba River, set amidst scenic splendour 
                  about one km. east of Cherukolpuzha, later became the famous 
                  Kurudamannil.</span></p>

                  six, sprung back resiliently, ventured on the most incredible 
                  enviable foundation. The wisdom and understanding, that the 
                  riches you get by dishonesty will soon disappear, made these 
                  six dynamic, hardworking brothers so earnest and enthusiastic 
                  and amassed all prosperity, with out any sophistication, by 
                  mere physical strength and sheer determination, which the present 
                  day (eighth) generation enjoys. Their dealings were just and 
                  righteous. The hard work of the brotherhood spread out their 
                  "small farm" from Ayroor up to Ranny, most of which was forests 
                  with dangerous wild life. They were not only wealthy farmers, 
                  but also very God fearing and kind men, who stood up against 
                  all the social injustices and their fame spread far and near. 
                  </span></p>
                <p><span class="normal">The 'magnificent' six brothers established 
                  their families and two dozen sons and two score daughters. ie:third 
                  generation. Most of this generation chose to follow their parents' 
                  footsteps as they were in an era where there were limited choices; 
                  nazranis had no opportunities in government jobs. Expansion 
                  and diversification started by these 2 dozen entrepreneurs spared 
                  no effort to enhance fame and fortune, embarked on new venture, 
                  trading, business etc. They were educated and intelligent as 
                  well as illustrious and took advantage of the opportunity in 
                  socio- political environment prevailed in the state. The ethos 
                  of being kind and caring echoes their efforts in establishing 
                  schools churches. The life expectancy was very short in their 
                  days, and due to the very nature of their adventurous and hard 
                  life style, many demised prematurely in life. </span></p>
                <p><span class="normal">They had a very strong religious upbringing. 
                  The heated passions involved deep split within the church and 
                  found embroiled in the fraught politics of Malankara church 
                  in crisis. Ayroor and Maramon, the heartlands of reformation 
                  pioneered by Rev. Abraham Malpan and his nephew Palakunnathu 
                  Mathews Mar Athanasios, there was great upheaval in the church 
                  history. Two sisters from Kurdamannil family were married to 
                  Palakunnathu and hence the geopolitical hot spot of reformation 
                  painfully were at odds. Unfortunately, there was a great acrimonious 
                  incident, ending in violence in Kozhencherry church, (AD1862) 
                  the aftermath being criminal court cases, prison sentences for 
                  some close relatives, nonetheless a pivotal turning point in 
                  the establishment of Mar Thoma Church. Unclouded by doubt, scepticism 
                  or blood relationship utterly convinced by their conscious stood 
                  by their conviction. All except four families were now active 
                  members of Marthoma church and both the Orthodox Church and 
                  Marthomma church in Ayroor came up side by side with the help 
                  of Kurdamannils. One can only be proud of the late H.G. Dr. 
                  Mathews Mar Athanasios, a stalwart in the Marthoma church, was 
                  one of the fourth generation fathers, who reached the high echelons 
                  in the church. The schools and institutions he built all over 
                  the state stands to cherish the contributions made by him envious.</span></p>
                <p><span class="normal">The attitude of our forefathers no doubt 
                  contributed to the uniform well being and social status of our 
                  present day generations. Another contributory factor to the 
                  sustained growth and prosperity has been the marriage alliances 
                  our forefathers forged with the best elite families of the land, 
                  which brought in its wake the qualities of up-rightness, honesty, 
                  truthfulness, intelligence and Godliness in their progeny. The 
                  greatest in our well being however is the faith of our fathers 
                  in God almighty, whose grace has led us hitherto. </span></p>
                <p><span class="normal">Despite minor skirmishes they all lived 
                  in harmony, a special family gathering (kudunba yogam) was started 
                  and the first meeting was in 1896 at the residence of Kaiplakel 
                  Peter Mathew and declared the family motto "dwell together in 
                  peace". Celebrating the centenary, the Kurudamannil family, 
                  adopted an emblem as shown - the six pillars (second generation) 
                  and the 24 radiant to the globe, depicting the third generation 
                  families and incorporated the motto "dwell together in peace".
